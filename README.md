# Taskcluster Retrospectives

Sometimes things go wrong. We don't like it when things go wrong, so let's talk about how to make them go wrong less.

This repository contains our retrospectives for events that occur in the operation of Taskcluster. Contributing a new one
is as easy as creating a PR into the project with a markdown file that matches the format specified in
[template.md](https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster-retrospectives/blob/master/template.md).
The file should go in the `retrospectives` directory and should be named `YYYY-MM-DD-${short descriptive title}.md`.

## Review Process

Once a PR is created, a set of interested parties should be assigned as reviewers. Reviewers can ask for changes to the
document and all discussion of the retrospective should occur in the PR. Once all reviewers are happy, the PR should be
merged and the retrospective will live in this repository.

## Updating Retrospectives

If a document has been merged into master and you wish to change some minor formatting or spelling, feel free. If you want to
make a larger change, consider adding it as an addendum to the document in question.
