# Taskcluster Retrospectives

Sometimes things go wrong. We don't like it when things go wrong, so let's talk about how to make them go wrong less.

This repository contains our retrospectives for events that occur in the operation of Taskcluster. Contributing a new one
is as easy as creating a PR into the project with a markdown file that matches the format specified in
[template.md](https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster-retrospectives/blob/master/template.md).
The file should go in the `retrospectives` directory and should be named `YYYY-MM-DD-${short descriptive title}.md`.
